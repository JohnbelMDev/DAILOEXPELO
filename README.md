This Python script connects to a Snowflake database—a cloud-based data storage system—to retrieve data based on a specific query. It logs each step of the process to a file named snowflake_query.log for tracking purposes.

Key Components:

Imports:

os: Accesses environment variables where sensitive information like usernames and passwords are stored.
snowflake.connector: Allows the script to communicate with the Snowflake database.
logging: Records events and errors during the script's execution.
typing: Provides type hints for better code clarity.
Logging Setup:

Configures logging to write messages to snowflake_query.log with details like time, severity level, and message content.
Functions:

get_snowflake_connection(): Establishes a connection to the Snowflake database using credentials stored in environment variables.
execute_query(conn, query, params): Executes a given SQL query securely, using parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks. It returns the query results as a list of dictionaries.
Main Execution:

Defines a sample SQL query to fetch data from a table where a column matches a specific value.
Sets the parameter for the query.
Attempts to connect to Snowflake and execute the query.
Prints the retrieved data.
Handles any errors that occur during the process.
Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are completed.
Simplified Explanation:

Imagine you have a library (the Snowflake database) and you want to find specific books (data) based on certain criteria. This script acts like a librarian who:

Uses a key (credentials) to enter the library.
Searches for books that match your criteria (executes the query).
Writes down the details of these books (retrieves the data).
Keeps a record of all actions taken (logs the process).
Closes the library door securely after finishing (closes the connection).
By breaking down the script into these components, it becomes easier to understand how it functions to retrieve data from a Snowflake database securely and efficiently.
